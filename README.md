# SongTester
Built in order for me to better learn the JUnit testing suite (specificially, JUnit 5). This program allows for the creation of a song object, called Mp3, and applies various business rules to the object's variables. The accompanying tests ensure that these rules are being applied and that relevant errors are thrown where necessary.
